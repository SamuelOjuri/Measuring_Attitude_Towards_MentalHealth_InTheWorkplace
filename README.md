## Measuring Attitude Towards Mental Health In The Workplace

#An Exploratory Comparison of Machine Learning Models measuring Attitude towards Mental Health in the Workplace


Working in the technology industry could be very challenging because the industry is
very competitive and fast-paced with some employees having to keep up with long working hours
and a high level of productivity. The inherent requirement for employees to continuously acquire
new skills at a rapid rate to remain relevant combined with other issues, such as the disruption of
work-life balance by the recent pandemic can create a critical need for stress management. It can
lead to mental health issues such as anxiety and depression which significantly impacts productivity
at work, and comes at a great cost to employers and the economy. 

The objective of this study is to analyze and predict the attitude of employees towards mental health in the workplace, so that
such models can be used to create proactive solutions that can enhance employee productivity. The
study aims to predict whether an employee is convenient with seeking mental health assistance
or not, presenting a binary classification problem. The study analyzed various machine learning
classification algorithms using supervised and deep learning models for the research objective with
an emphasis on performance enhancement techniques. Empirical results obtained confirm that the
models can be applied in creating solutions for boosting productivity in the workplace. The research
creates an opportunity for further research into creating awareness and addressing ethical issues of
mental health in the tech industry.

Research and analysis from the Thriving atWork Review state that poor mental health of employees
cost employers between £33 billion and £42 billion each year, with an estimated annual cost of
between £74 billion and £99 billion to the UK economy. A good proportion of employees experience
common mental health issues, including anxiety and depression, which significantly impacts
their productivity at work.

The dataset used for analysis is the ‘OSMI Mental Health
in Tech Survey 2016’, which was a survey carried out in 2016 to document the attitude
of employees in the Tech industry towards mental health. More details can be found at
https://osmhhelp.org/research . The response variable selected from the dataset aims to predict
whether an employee will seek treatment for mental health or not, presenting a binary classification
problem. Details of the survey questions used to capture the underlying data can be found at
https://osmi.typeform.com/report/Ao6BTw/U76z . 1,570 responses were recorded. The dataset
used for analysis is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mentalhealth-
